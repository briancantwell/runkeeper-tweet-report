1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?
I feel I earned the points below due the the sheer number of hours, stress, and hairloss I experienced while doing this
assignment. Though I was not able to fully implment the button for the charts, I was successful in dynamicly inputting the
activities into the vega chart. Additionally I also spent quite a bit of time figuring out how to properly filter the tweets as to 
attain the most accurate filtering possible.

11/10
- 1/1 Tweet dates
- 1/1 Tweet categories
- 1/1 User-written tweets
- 3/2 Determining activity type and distance
- 2/2 Graphing activities by distance
- 1/1 Implementing the search box
- 2/2 Populating the table

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    I honestly lost track after about 30 hours. This was one of the 
    most time consuming assignments I've ever worked on. 


3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials, etc.)
here are a couple listed below, but after ripping my hair out searching for how to use Vega-lite, I stopped keeping track because I was just trying to finish.

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    I got help from a couple people ouside of class. We discussed mostly how to do the Vega section and 
    how needlessly difficult this assignment is.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
